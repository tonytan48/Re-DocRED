# Re-DocRED Dataset

This repository contains the dataset of our EMNLP 2022 research paper [Revisiting DocRED – Addressing the False Negative Problem
in Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12696.pdf). 

DocRED is a widely used benchmark for document-level relation extraction. However, the DocRED dataset contains a significant percentage of false negative examples (incomplete annotation). We revised 4,053 documents in the DocRED dataset and resolved its problems. We released this dataset as: Re-DocRED dataset.

The Re-DocRED Dataset resolved the following problems of DocRED:
1. Resolved the incompleteness problem by supplementing large amounts of relation triples.
2. Addressed the logical inconsistencies in DocRED.
3. Corrected the coreferential errors within DocRED.

# Statistics of Re-DocRED
The Re-DocRED dataset is located as ./data directory, the statistics of the dataset are shown below:
